When you press it, a new tweet will be generated. TweetGPT will choose a random type of tweet: positive, negative, controversial, etc.

For a reply, it will generate a tweet based on the original tweet. For a new tweet, it will write a tweet based on what's trending right now.

## ⚠️ Warning
TweetGPT generates positive, negative and controversial tweets _randomly_. It will sometimes generate controversial or even offensive tweets.
Remember, this is like an L2 autopilot - the driver is responsible for the outcome. Don't tweet what you disagree with, just re-generate the tweet instead.
